# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

I will be answering the following questions: What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

## What is the population of Des Moines and how does it compare to New York City?

NYC has 8,336,817 residents while Des Moines has 214,237 residents. There is quite a difference in quantity of people residing within the metropolitan area. Upon researching the area of each metro area, there are roughly 89 people per mile of NYC. Alternatively, there are 31 people per mile of Des Moines metro area.

### Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

When investing in Des Moines Citibike, it would be appropriate to dispatch about 4% the number of bikes that are currently dispatched to NYC (considering population differential). Citibike will focus the placement of the Des Moines bikes to the downtown metro area near major public transit areas, heavy tourist attractions and universities. The population does not affect who will use the bike sharing; NYC and Des Moines are synonymous populations as far as % employed, sex, poverty rates, and residents aged 18-65.

# Des Moines Citibikes are worth investing in (to scale vs. NYC) as the population and geographical layout are similar and would yeild lucrative results for investors.
